Created a new service (provider) with "ionic g provider productcategory", that I hope will be the file I can use to the list
the relevant products in each the category pages (ipad, iphone etc).


**REQUIRED**
Need a similar master/detail structure in the narrower category pages at ipad, iphone, laptop etc 
(list pulls only products for that category)
